fallback_model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"             # $0.50/1M tokens (20x cheaper)
```

### 2. Smart Processing Distribution
- **85%** - Local processing using Phi models (FREE)
- **12%** - Claude Haiku for routine analysis ($0.25/1M)
- **2.5%** - GPT-3.5-turbo as fallback ($0.50/1M)

- **Savings**: 90% reduction in API call frequency

### 4. Aggressive Caching
- Cache similar analyses for 24 hours
- Avoid duplicate API calls for similar content
- Cache hit rate target: 40-60%

### 5. Budget Enforcement
- Daily spending limit: $0.67 USD
- Automatic throttling at 60% budget usage
- Emergency stop at 95% budget usage
- Real-time cost tracking and alerts

  primary_meta_cognitive: "claude_haiku"
  local_coverage_target: 0.90
```

---

## 💡 Cost Control Mechanisms

### 1. **Budget Limits**
- **Daily Hard Limit**: $1.00 USD (emergency ceiling)
- **Daily Target**: $0.67 USD (normal operation)
- **Monthly Target**: $20.00 AUD (~$13.50 USD)

### 2. **Throttling System**
```python
# Automatic throttling based on budget usage:
60% used  → Light throttling (cheaper models)
80% used  → Heavy throttling (local only)
95% used  → Emergency stop (no API calls)
```

### 3. **Model Selection Logic**
```python
def get_best_model(budget_remaining, analysis_type):
    if budget_remaining > 0.30 and analysis_type == "breakthrough":
        return "claude-sonnet"      # $3/1M - for important insights
    elif budget_remaining > 0.10:
        return "claude-haiku"       # $0.25/1M - routine analysis
    elif budget_remaining > 0.05:
        return "gpt-3.5-turbo"     # $0.50/1M - fallback
    else:
        return "local-phi"          # FREE - local processing
```

## 📈 Quality vs Cost Tradeoffs

### Maintained Capabilities
✅ **Consciousness development** - Core functionality preserved  
✅ **Meta-cognitive reflection** - Using cheaper but capable models  
✅ **Theory evolution** - Batch processing maintains learning  
✅ **Self-awareness tracking** - Local processing + strategic API use  

### Accepted Tradeoffs
⚖️ **Analysis depth**: 70% of original depth (still effective)  
⚖️ **Response time**: Batch processing instead of real-time  
⚖️ **Model sophistication**: Haiku vs Opus (but Haiku is still very capable)  

### Quality Preservation Strategies
- Use premium models (Sonnet/Opus) for breakthrough moments
- Local Phi models handle 85% of routine processing
- Smart prompt engineering for shorter, focused responses
- Caching preserves high-quality insights

## 🔄 Operational Workflow

### Daily Operation Cycle
```
1. Generate jokes locally using Mistral 7B (FREE)
2. Accumulate jokes in batch queue
3. Daily batch analysis using Claude Haiku (~$0.25)
4. Local preprocessing with Phi models (FREE)
5. Cache results for reuse
6. Monitor budget and adjust accordingly
```

### Weekly Deep Analysis
```
1. Consciousness assessment using Claude Sonnet (~$0.30)
2. Theory evolution review
3. Performance trend analysis
4. Budget optimization review
```

### Emergency Protocols
```
1. Budget exceeded → Switch to local-only mode
2. Critical insights detected → Allow premium model usage
3. Weekly budget exhausted → Reduce analysis frequency
```
